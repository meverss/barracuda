.SH DESCRIPTION

Barracuda theme makes \fBfish\fP shell even more powerful and user-friendly.

It's equipped with a set of useful functions and key bindings to
speed up your workflow.

Also, the use of \fBPowerline Nerd\fP fonts makes the visual experience
smooth and fancy.

This theme is a fork of \fBoh-my-fish/theme-budspencer\fP
(\fIhttps://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-budspencer\fP),
which means it keeps most of it's awesome features.

.SS Quickly navigate in history of working directories:

The function \fId\fP drops down a menu showing the history
as enumerated list. Unlike fish's builtin \fIdir\fP, \fId\fP
does not show any duplicates. Enter a number to jump
to a directory within the list.

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
.IP \(bu 4
Press \fBAlt\fP + \fBH\fP in \fBNORMAL\fP mode to change present
working directory to previous working directory in history.
.IP \(bu 4
Press \fBAlt\fP + \fBL\fP in \fBNORMAL\fP mode to change present
working directory to next working directory in history.

.SS Quickly navigate in command history:

The function \fIc\fP drops down a menu showing the command
history as enumerated list similarly to the \fId\fP function
Selections are also pasted into the X clipboard.

.SS Bookmarks:

A bookmark can be created with \fImark\fP. It can be removed
with \fIunmark\fP. 

\fIunmark\fP can take an argument to remove a specific bookmark
in the bookmark list. Simply add the number of the bookmark
you would like to remove as the argument.

Bookmarks are universal and thus persistant.
A new shell automatically changes working directory on startup
to newest bookmark.

\fIm\fP is a function that drops down a menu showing the bookmarks as enumerated list
equivalently to \fId\fP.

The following shortcuts need vi mode:
.IP \(bu 4
Create a bookmark for present working directory with \fBAlt\fP + \fBm\fP in \fBNORMAL\fP mode.
.IP \(bu 4
Remove a bookmark for present working directory with \fBAlt\fP + \fBM\fP in \fBNORMAL\fP mode.

By default the shell will change to the directory of the latest bookmark on a new session. 
This can be disabled by adding the following line:

.R set -U barracuda_no_cd_bookmark

.SS Sessions:

Shell session can be stored with \fIs <session name>\fP. If a session with \fI<session name>\fP` already exists, the session with this name will be attached. If a session with
\fI<session name>\fP is already active within another terminal, this terminal will be
focussed.

A list of available sessions can be shown with \fIs\fP.

A session can be erased with \fIs -e <session name>\fP.

Type \fIs -d\fP to detach current session.

.SS Set window title:

Just type \fIwt <title>\fP.

.SS Ring the bell in order to set the urgency hint flag:

If you have configured your terminal application to use
the visual bell, your window manager will tell you when
a job running in your shell has finished. You don'
need to check manually whether it's done.

It is deactivated by default, but you can ebable/disable
it by typing \fIbell on\fP/\fIoff\fP

.SS Battery status:

To enable/disable battery icon on right prompt, type \fIbattery on\fP/\fIoff\fP

.SS Change font (Termux):

To change system font type \fIchfont\fP

.SS Backup function (Termux):

With this function it's possible to perform a full backup
of system and user's files.

To create a new backup type:

.R backup [[-c][--create] [<file name>]

To list existing backups use:

.R backup [-l][--list]

To delete an existing backup:

.R backup [-d][--delete]

To show help:

.R backup [-h][--help]



Unfortunately this function can only perform backups. Restores have to be decompressed and copied manually.
